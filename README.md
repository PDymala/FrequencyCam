# FrequencyCam
Live preview of image frequency domain (FFT)
<img src="fficon.png" width="100" />

Following app uses captured frames to analyze their spatial domain (frequency domain or fourier domain). Those are live previewed.
You can choose either standard view, frequency or phase. Couple of extra features like rotation, matrix, quality etc.

Only in landscape mode due to opencv.

## App:

<img src="FrequencyGUI.png" width="400" />


Mode: Normal view / Frequency / Phase<BR>
Grid: 1x1 or 4x4<BR>
Camera quality - Lowers the image quality before FFT<BR>
Stretch - Stretch the image to full screen or square (native FFT)<BR>
Rotate - rotate each cell towards middle (native FFT) or outside <BR>
Camera zoom - zoom of camera before FFT<BR>
Image zoom - zoom of converted image, after FFT<BR>
Flashlight - as the name suggests<BR>
Exit - as the name suggests<BR>
