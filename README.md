<img src="fficon.png" width="100" />

Following app uses captured frames to analyze their spatial domain (frequency domain or fourier domain). Those are live previewed.
You can choose either standard view, frequency or phase. Couple of extra features like rotation, matrix, quality etc.

Only in landscape mode due to opencv.


*** 12-12.2021 ***
Added some functionalities like cam zoom, preview zoom, better quality control. Unfortunately, this was done with the help of camera api 1 instead of 2, that is why, it's another branch. At some moment I will change that one to be default.
